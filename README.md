Imp IDE code downloader
=======================

This tool requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) to already be installed.

To download the code for one of your Imp IDE models just enter your Imp IDE email address and password and the name of the model you want to download.

The following shows the tool in action:

    $ node get-code.js 
    Enter your Imp IDE email address and password.
    Email: foo@bar.com
    Password: foobar
    Save token to skip login step next time? [y] 
    Info: saved token
    Models:
        Clock
        Gpio
        Hello World
        LED Counter
    Enter model name: Hello World
    Info: "Hello World" has no agent code
    Info: saved device.nut

If you press return or enter `y` at the point where it asks you whether you want to skip the login step next time then it will save a token generated by the IDE to the file `imp-token.txt` and use this next time you use the tool.

The tool will retrieve the code for the model and store it in the files `agent.nut` and `device.nut`, if the particular model does not have agent or device code then the corresponding file will not be created.
